# Udacity CarND student work - Humphrey

The Udacity Self-Driving-Car Engineer Nanodegree program (CarND) delivers extremely high-quality, graduate-degree level instruction mostly via online videos and quizzes, but the most important part of the program is the requirement to complete five relatively rigorous projects in each of the three terms. 

## Sidenote:

*Hey fellow students! Sorry, I just rediscovered this repository when I was working on one of the later SDC projects. This public repository is whoafully out-of-date, as I'm doing all of my source control in private repos now. If you need access to my work, I probably already sent you a link to my private repos, but if not, please email me and I'll grant you access. See ya online!*

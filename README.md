# Udacity CarND student work - Humphrey

The Udacity Self-Driving-Car Engineer Nanodegree program (CarND) delivers extremely high-quality, graduate-degree level instruction mostly via online videos and quizzes, but the most important part of the program is the requirement to complete five relatively rigorous projects in each of the three 90-day terms. These are our submissions:
